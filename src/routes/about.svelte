<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I spend a greater portion of my time working on side projects or helping
  friends with theirs. I tend to continuously have a side project underway. I
  love to collaborate on ideas and scheming about entrepreneurial possibilities.
</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The coffee industry. When I travel I like to explore local, third-wave
      coffee shops and roasteries. I'm honing in on a great home pour-over.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Video games and eSports. I especially enjoy extremely challenging games,
      couch co-op games, and games that are a social experience.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Game development, game design, and interactive art.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Cinematography—I only started my journey a few years ago. Initially a fan
      of Hayao Miyazaki, Taika Waititi, and Wes Anderson. I've since fallen in
      love with works by Robert Eggers, Goran Stolevski, Yorgos Lanthimos, Bora
      Kim, and Hirokazu Koreeda.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      I enjoy finding new music. I follow the post-punk, post-hardcore, and
      similar aggressive genres most actively.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Poetry and folklore stories—I started writing poems last year and am pushing myself to write more.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
